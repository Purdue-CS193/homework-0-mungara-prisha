# Prisha's First CS193 Homework

## Things I like about CS193
- The lectures are helpful and interesting for getting started with CS courses at Purdue
- The question slides are funny ('Is emo a phase or a lifestyle?')
- The magic word is always fun
- We play games at the beginning
- It's a warm, welcoming introduction to CS
- I feel like CS puns would be quite appreciated here, but I don't have much data to prove it :(
